# Getting Started

This section walks you through installing Haske, creating your first project, and understanding the default layout. If you have not yet installed the framework, begin with the installation guide. Once Haske is available in your environment you can scaffold a project with the built-in CLI and run the development server in minutes.

Before diving into production workloads, skim the project structure overview so you know where routing logic, templates, static assets, and configuration live. The remaining chapters elaborate on each subsystem in detail.
